Phase4_object_zonemarking - This is a 'zone' of the castle. The script Scripts_zoneentered
holds the message that you want to appear on the screen when the player walks into the zone.
The style parameter holds the text style stuff for the text that appears when you walk into
the zone. Fadetime is how long the text stays on the screen before disappearing. Fadespeed
is how fast the text fades. Hasentered is a boolean that holds whether the player is in the
zone and should be ignored.

ALL OBJECTS THAT ARE ZONES SHOULD BE MARKED WITH A 'Zone' TAG


Phase4_objects_fadetest - This is just a normal object that will fade in and out of the scene.
The parameter fadespeed affects how fast the objects fade and the parameter resident zone
should be set to the Phase4_object_zonemarking that the object is in. If the player walks into
the zone set, the object will fade out.

Phase4_objects_visibilitybutton - This is the button that you press that causes the object set
to fade out when the player clicks the button. Objecttofade holds the object that the button
will cause to fade. Fadespeed determines how fast the object will fade. Willfade is a boolean
that holds the status of the button and should not be touched.

ALL OBJECTS THAT ARE BUTTONS SHOULD BE MARKED WITH A 'Button' TAG


Scripts_interactscript - This is a script attached to the player that allows for the player
to click on the button to cause the object attached to the button to fade.

MINIMAP RELATED STUFF =====================================================

Phase4_Objects_mapcam - This is the camera that displays the minimap. In Camera settings,
make sure the Culling Mask is set to Minimap ONLY. The Projection should also be set to
Orthographic. The script Scripts_mapFollowScript should be attachec to this camera.

Scripts_mapFollowScript - The player parameter should be set to the player. Maps is an array
containing the 3 parts of the minimap in this case, the size should be 3 and the three elements
should be set to the first floor, second floor, and third floor respectively. currentMap
should represent the floor that the player starts on and should be set as such. PersonTexture
is the icon on the minimap that shows where the player is standing, I used a small blue circle
as a placeholder.

Phase4_objects_mapfloor1(2,3) - These Objects are the minimaps, I scaled them up to the size
of the map and separated them with the first floor on the bottom and the third floor on top.
The materials attached to them, mapMat(1,2,3) have the minimap images on them.

Phase4_objects_betweenFloors - This is an object with two children. Its purpose it to change
the current state of the minimap when a player changes floors. Each child has one collider in
it with the istrigger box checked. They should be next to each other. Both children have the script
Scripts_switchMinimap attached to them. This object should be duplicated and placed on the
stairways so that the mapcam knows when to change the current floor. This object comes with
two colliders and they should be used together. One collider should switch to the floor that
it is nearest and the other one should switch to the floor on the other side. This allows
for the floor to change when the player is going down as well as up the stairs.

Scripts_switchMinimap - This script allows the mapcam to change which floor it is displaying.
The map cam parameter should be set to the mapcam. The toFloor parameter should be set to
the floor that is closest to the collider.

Other changes - I am going to begin messing with the player and all of the movement scripts to
make it more lifelike, there may be a few changes implemented, such as head bobbing and a
locked cursor.
